You are the bodyguard and you must ensure the VIP stays alive by killing any would-be assassins. You'll receive radio communications to help you pin down which of the civilians is really an assassin. 

Once you've found the assassin, take your shot before they have a chance to kill the VIP!

Play progressively harder levels with more and more civilians but try not to shoot any innocent bystanders, they won't like that very much.

My high score is level 9, see if you can beat it!

Some tips for success (Read if you don't care to discover them yourself):

* After 35 seconds the assassin can stab the VIP
* If someone walks through the VIP past 35 seconds, they probably aren't the assassin
* If you hear a sound and the screen shakes, the assassin tried to stab the VIP but failed. He's probably still close by!
* After 120 seconds the assassin will aggressively seek out the VIP
* Take a warning shot to stop the civilians for a second!
